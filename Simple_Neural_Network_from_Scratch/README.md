# First Neural Network from Sratch 
This project is about building a simple multi-layer fully connected Neural Network to predict bike shares. Instead of using other popular deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow, I decided to implement the forward prop and back prop by myself. This way, the project could help me to reinforce my understanding of the basic algorithm behind a neural network. The only l;ibrary that I have used in this project is numpy and pandas(for data preparing).
